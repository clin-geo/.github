# Clinical Geocoding (clin-geo) Organization

Organization created to support collaboration across people and groups working on HIPAA-compliant/privacy-senitive methods for geocoding for clinical and clinical research purposes.

## Inspired by

## Future Goals
- [ ] Explore python-based workflow (containerized or not) taking advantage of duckdb geospatial support
- [ ] If performant, ideally minimize number of languages, Ruby and non-precompile C may no longer be necessary
- [ ] Release tools to support GUI workflows with hosted PostGIS configurations (these tools have been built in development, but are not yet ready for public release)
- [ ] provide support for geo-routing to estimate time and distance between locations (likely use open street map, but consider arbitrarily supporting any two addresses rather than just isocrons with known clinic locations)
